		<em>My new Pluralsight course, "A Functional Architecture with F#", is now available.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Whenever I've talked to object-oriented developers about F#, a common reaction has been that it looks enticing, but that they don't see how they'd be able to build a 'normal' application with it. F# has gained a reputation for being a 'niche' language, good for scientific computation and financial calculations, but not useful for mainstream applications.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not only is F# a Turing-complete, general purpose programming language, but it has <em>many</em> advantages to offer compared to, say, C#. That said, though, building a 'normal' application with F# will only make sense if you know how to work <em>with</em> the language, and define an architecture that takes advantage of all it has to offer. Therefore, I thought that it would be valuable to show one possible way to do this, through a comprehensive example.
	</p>
	<p>
		This was the motivation behind my new <a href="http://pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a> course <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/functional-architecture-fsharp">A Functional Architecture with F#</a>, which is now available! In it, you'll see extensive code demos of a web application written entirely in F# (and a bit of GUI in JavaScript, but the course only shows the F# code).
