		The <a href="http://www.ndcoslo.com/">NDC 2013</a> conference is over, and most (if not all) of the session recordings <a href="http://vimeo.com/ndcoslo">are now available</a>. Specifically, both of the talks I gave were recorded and are now available for general viewing.
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="http://vimeo.com/68236489">Faking Homoiconicity in C# with graphs</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="http://vimeo.com/68378923">Big Object Graphs Up Front</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
		As a bonus, <a href="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/">Jimmy Bogard</a> gave a talk on <a href="http://vimeo.com/68390508">Holistic testing</a> with quite a bit of <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture">AutoFixture</a> content.
