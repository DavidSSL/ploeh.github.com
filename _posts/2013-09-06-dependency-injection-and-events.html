		<em>Overview of articles about Dependency Injection and events.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		One of my readers, Kenny Pflug, asks me about subscribing to events in the constructor of a class using Constructor Injection:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			I want to register to a plain old .NET event of a dependency that is supplied via constructor injection. I read your book "<a href="http://amzn.to/12p90MG">DI in .NET</a>" and in it you mention that injection constructors should be simple and not perform any other work than guarding for null values and assigning the dependencies to (read-only) fields. I also read on your blog that <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/03/03/InjectionConstructorsshouldbesimple">this is only a pattern and might be broken gently if the need would arise</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			[...] do you know and prefer any patterns to solve this "registering to events of dependencies in a constructor" problem?
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		In short, I think that it's a code smell if a design requires you to subscribe to an event in the constructor; it's a smell that the dependency chain is slightly inverted. Inversion of Inversion of Control - how about that?
	</p>
	<p>
		In the next series of posts, I'll attempt to provide various perspectives on this situation, starting with the original context.

		</ul>

	<p>
		In summary, it's probably not going to be a big problem if you subscribe to an event in a constructor, but it's a code smell, because it betrays a design issue.
