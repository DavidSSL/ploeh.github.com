	<p>
		At the Danish Developer Conference 2013 I had the pleasure of meeting <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/">Jon Galloway</a>, who interviewed me for <a href="http://herdingcode.com/?p=539">a Herding Code podcast</a>. In this interview, we talk about <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture">AutoFixture</a>, <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/03/11/listen-to-trivial-tests">testing (or not testing) trivial code</a>, as well as lots of the unit testing topics I also cover in <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/advanced-unit-testing">my Pluralsight course on Advanced Unit Testing</a>.
