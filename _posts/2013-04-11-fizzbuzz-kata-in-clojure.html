		<em>This post describes my first experience with doing the FizzBuzz kata in Clojure.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		After having looked at <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> for some time, I finally had a bit of time to play with it, so I decided to do the <a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataFizzBuzz">FizzBuzz kata</a> in Clojure.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Single fizzbuzz function</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Clojure has a built-in testing framework, so I wrote a Parameterized Test for a single fizzbuzz function. Using TDD, I added test cases a little at a time, attempting to follow the <a href="http://cleancoder.posterous.com/the-transformation-priority-premise">Transformation Priority Premise</a>, but the end result is this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>(ns fizzbuzz.core-test
  (:use clojure.test
        fizzbuzz.core))

(deftest fizzbuzz-test
  (are [expected i] (= expected (fizzbuzz i))
       "1" 1
       "2" 2
       "Fizz" 3
       "4" 4
       "Buzz" 5
       "Fizz" 6
       "7" 7
       "8" 8
       "Fizz" 9
       "Buzz" 10
       "11" 11
       "Fizz" 12
       "13" 13
       "14" 14
       "FizzBuzz" 15
       "FizzBuzz" 30))</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Clojure syntax is somewhat backwards from what I'm normally used to, but the <a href="http://richhickey.github.io/clojure/clojure.test-api.html#clojure.test/are">are</a> macro expands into a collection of tests that each evaluate whether the result of invoking the fizzbuzz function with <code>i</code> is equal to <code>expected</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Through a series of transformations of the SUT, I ended up with this implementation of the fizzbuzz function:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>(ns fizzbuzz.core)

(defn fizzbuzz [i]
  (cond
    (= 0 (mod i 15)) "FizzBuzz"
    (= 0 (mod i 3)) "Fizz"
    (= 0 (mod i 5)) "Buzz"
    :else (str i)))</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This defines a function called <em>fizzbuzz</em> taking a single argument <code>i</code>. The <a href="http://richhickey.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/cond">cond</a> macro evaluates each test and returns the expression associated with the first test that evauluates to true. The first test checks if <code>i</code> is divisible with 15 and returns "FizzBuzz" if this is the case; the next test checks if <code>i</code> is divisible with 3 and returns "Fizz" if this is true, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Printing a range of fizzbuzz values</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		The task defined by the kata is to print all FizzBuzz values from 1 to 100, so the above function is't the final solution. The next step I took was to write a test that defines a version of the fizzbuzz function taking two parameters:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>(def acceptance-expected
"1

(deftest acceptance-test
  (is (= acceptance-expected (fizzbuzz 1 101))))</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		I decided to define the <code>acceptance-expected</code> value outside of the test case itself, as I thought that made the test a bit more readable. The test case is defined by the <a href="http://richhickey.github.io/clojure/clojure.test-api.html#clojure.test/is">is</a> macro and states that the expected value is <code>acceptance-expected</code> and the actual value is the result of invoking the fizzbuzz function with <em>two</em> arguments: 1 as the (inclusive) start value, and 101 as the (exclusive) end value. The above code listing of fizzbuzz only accept one argument, but the new test case requires two arguments, so I added an overload to the function:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>(defn fizzbuzz
  ([i]
    (cond
      (= 0 (mod i 15)) "FizzBuzz"
      (= 0 (mod i 3)) "Fizz"
      (= 0 (mod i 5)) "Buzz"
      :else (str i)))
  ([start end]
    (apply str
      (interpose "\n"
        (map fizzbuzz (range start end))))))</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The previous implementation is still there, now contained within the overload taking a single argument <code>i</code>, but now there's also a new overload taking two arguments: <code>start</code> and <code>end</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This overload generates a sequence of integers from <code>start</code> to <code>end</code> using the <a href="http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/range">range</a> function. It then maps that sequence of integers into a sequence of strings by <a href="http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/map">mapping</a> each integer to a string with the fizzbuzz function. That gives you a sequence of strings such as <code>("1" "2" "Fizz" "4" "Buzz")</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to print all the FizzBuzz strings, I need to <a href="http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/interpose">interpose</a> a newline character between each string, which produces a new sequence of strings such as <code>("1" "\n" "2" "\n" "Fizz" "\n" "4" "\n" "Buzz")</code>. To concatenate all these strings, I <a href="http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/apply">apply</a> the <a href="http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/str">str</a> function to the sequence.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Printing FizzBuzz values from 1 to 100</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		The requirements of the kata is to print all FizzBuzz values from 1 to 100, and the code already does this. However, I interpret the kata as requiring a single function that takes no parameters, so I added an acceptance test case:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>(deftest acceptance-test
  (is (= acceptance-expected (fizzbuzz 1 101)))
  (is (= acceptance-expected (fizzbuzz))))</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice the second test case in the last line of code that invokes the fizzbuzz function without any parameters. It's easily resolved by adding a third overload:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>(defn fizzbuzz
  ([]
    (fizzbuzz 1 101))
  ([i]
    (cond
      (= 0 (mod i 15)) "FizzBuzz"
      (= 0 (mod i 3)) "Fizz"
      (= 0 (mod i 5)) "Buzz"
      :else (str i)))
  ([start end]
    (apply str
      (interpose "\n"
        (map fizzbuzz (range start end))))))</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		As you can see, the first overload takes no parameters and simply invokes the previously desribed overload with the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> arguments.
	</p>
	<p>
		FWIW, this entire solution is structurally similar to <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/07/20/FizzBuzzkatainFstage1/">my implementation of FizzBuzz in F#</a>.
